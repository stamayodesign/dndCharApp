# RPG Dice Roller - Kotlin Project
### Introduction
This project was made in Android Studio from April 2022 - May 2022. The application allows for simulated dice rolling ranging from multiples of the same die, multiples of different dies, and custom dice inputs. The application also allows the addition of modifiers before OR after the dice roll.

My inspiration for this project was that I wanted to add Kotlin to my toolbelt as a software developer and my hobbies of various TableTop Role Playing Games (TTRPGs) including Dungeons & Dragons, Ironsworn, and GURPs. 

## How it works
1. [Single Dice Tab](#sdt)<br/>
2. [Multi Dice Tab](#mdt)<br/>
3. [Custom Dice Tab](#cdt)<br/>

### <a name="sdt"></a>Single Dice Tab
### <a name="mdt"></a>Multi Dice Tab
### <a name="cdt"></a>Custom Dice Tab
